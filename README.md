## My Journey

In the past three years, I've immersed myself in various programming languages, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, and Python. My skills have evolved significantly since I created my first webpage on September 16, 2021. Since then, I've embarked on numerous projects, including web development and video editing, two of my greatest passions.

Under the banner of Xinitry, I offer services in web development and video editing. Through my YouTube channel, I showcase my editing skills and share various content. Additionally, I engage with a supportive community through live streaming on Twitch.

## Entrepreneurial Ventures

I've undertaken entrepreneurial ventures such as developing an ERP system for my mother's small business, Rincón Poupée, which involved integrating various APIs to enhance efficiency. I've also explored Linux and AWS services, continuously expanding my skill set and knowledge base.

## Creative Endeavors

Beyond programming and video editing, I've ventured into visual effects using Blender and produced several short video projects covering diverse topics such as Bitcoin, horror narratives, and the implications of AI on trust.
